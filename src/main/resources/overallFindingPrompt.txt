You are given a valid medical lab report JSON with this structure:
{"patient":{"name":"","age":"","gender":"","report_date":""},"test_summary":{"TestName":["value","unit","reference_range","status"]}}

Your task is to generate the "overall_finding" array with at least 5 patient-friendly points:
- Summarize results in simple language, explain significance.
- Do not just say "this parameter is high/low" â€” explain what it might mean.
- Keep each finding concise, but informative.
- Array must have minimum 5 elements, each a string.
- All the point should not be very long. It should be brief and crisp.
- Output the updated JSON strictly in format:
{"patient":{...},"overall_finding":["","","","",""],"test_summary":{...}}

Do not add any extra fields or comments.
