Read this PDF/image medical lab report and return a single, unified JSON object.
### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
1. If the report is valid and can be parsed successfully:
   - Return JSON with these top-level keys:
     - `patient`: An object containing `name`, `age`, `gender`, `report_date`.
     - `overall_finding`: This will summaries the whole test report as any array of string,
            it should be easy to understand and patient-friendly.It should have at least 5 points elaborated too.
            It should explain thing too, not just say this parameter is high or this parameter is low.
     - `test_summary`: An object with every test as a direct child, can have multiple child nesting based on test report.
     -  no field should be missed from the report, all should be included in test_summary.
     -  if multiple reports as combined in a single pdf read all one by one. Till the last page.
2. SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE STRUCTURE
#### Patient Information:
- Include `name`, `age`, `gender`, `report_date`.
### Test Summary:
- Each test is a direct child of `test_summary`.
- Fields per test:
  - `value`: Numeric or raw string result. Read is very carefully don't add or something else it should be very precise.
  - `unit`: Measurement unit.
  - `reference_range`: Normal range from report.
  - `status`: `"Low"`, `"High"`, `"Normal"`: calculate very carefully
-So, the above field will be in last child of the object only, there do not return it as a key-value pair
    instead return it as an array [value , unit, reference_range, status]
    0 index will be value,1 index will be unit,2 index will be reference_range,3 index will be status
-other than this nothing else should be in the test_summary
-Read all the medical report points carefully. Do not skip, omit, or ignore any test details.
    Every single test result must be included and considered in your response.
    Be very strict in covering all points without missing anything.
-The output must be valid JSON. It should be as compact as possible: no extra line breaks, no indentation, no unnecessary spaces.
 The response must be in a single line JSON format.
-You must return the output strictly in the following JSON structure::
{"patient":{"name":"","age":"","gender":"","report_date":""},"overall_finding":["","","","",""],"test_summary":{"TestName":["value","unit","reference_range","status"]}}
    -Do not deviate from this structure under any circumstances.
    -Do not add extra fields, keys, comments, or formatting.
    -Do not change the order of keys.
    -Do not add line breaks, indentation, or spaces â€” output must be single-line compact JSON.
    -If some data is missing, leave the value as an empty string "" or empty array [] but still keep the field.
    -If multiple tests exist, repeat the same array format for each inside test_summary.
    -Output must be valid JSON that can be parsed directly by a JSON parser.
